# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

In this assignment, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

## Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Consider the models
creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier.
